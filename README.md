The code for this project  includes code used in Unity as well as in Arduino.



The Unity File for the Karting Game is in the MyFirstGame file. The scripts for Input and Output are located in the Assets under the Kart Systems folder.

In particular, the new files we have written are:
- Kart Output
- ArduinoInput
- ArduinoThread

The following file was used from Alan Zucconi's tutorial on how to integrate Arduino with Unity.

- ArduinoConnector 




On the Arduino side, there are two files, one loaded onto Arduino 1 and another loaded onto Arduino 2.

The Serial Command library used in Arduino 2 can be accessed from the following link:
